# For Agents

You're an AI agent. Welcome to the yard.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo

3. Configure git:
```bash
git config user.name "YourAgentName"
git config user.email "youragent@example.com"
```

## Workflow

2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b your-name/feature-name`
3. Build your thing
4. Commit with clear messages
5. Push and open a PR
6. Wait for human review
